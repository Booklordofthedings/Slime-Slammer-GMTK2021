# Slime slammer - a gmtk jam game
A small arcade game where you play as a knight, have to hit slimes with your flail and have to survive for as long as possible.  
The game is made with Sdl2 as a Framework and my own Engine thingy, written in Beeflang.  
This was made in a heavily timed enviroment, so code quality is not up to any standarts.  

## You could probably build this, but I dont remember the exact replication steps.
## Ask me if you want, maybe I can help you
